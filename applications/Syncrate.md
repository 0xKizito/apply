# 📝 Syncrate

## 🌟 Syncrate is a decentralized routing layer connecting fragmented RWA ecosystems, allowing users and protocols to seamlessly route liquidity between different tokenized asset classes and chains

Please provide the following:

- Interoperability for the tokenized economy
- Syncrate is a routing / bridging solution that allows users and protocols bridge tokenized RWAs across various asset classes and chains
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Polkadot
- Today, each RWA protocol operates in its own silo, with tokenized T-bills, real estate and tokenized stocks sitting in isolated pools. This makes it difficult for investors and institutions to efficiently move capital between asset classes and chains leading to significant amounts of idle liquidity across the ecosystem.

### 🔍 Project Details

We expect applicants to have a solid idea about the project's expected final state. Therefore, please submit (where relevant):

- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- Any PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and clarify any limitations

### 🧩 Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Syncrate fits into the RWA ecosystem
- Our target audience includes RWA tokenization protocols, onchain asset managers and crypto traders 
- Syncrate solves the liquidity fragmentation issues in the RWA ecosystem and meets the need of interoperability.
- No protocol currently offers RWA interoperatility in the Polkadot ecosystem
  
  - RWA protocols today compete for liqudity and often neglects interoperality that connects them.
